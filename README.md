This was created as a final project for my Math 4500 Numerical Analysis I class.
My group members and I used Euler's method and a 2-step Runge Kutta scheme in 
order to estimate the decay rate of an environmental pollutant as it travels 
through a volume of groundwater. 

Common external python packages such as matplotlib and numpy were used.
